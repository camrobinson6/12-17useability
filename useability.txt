Session Base TestingTablesEvens and Odds:Filter Object:Filter Strings:Palindrome:Sum:Start Time/Date:12:30 pm Dec. 17thTester: CameronTask Breakdown:* Navigate to the following url: https://devmountain-qa.github.io/Automation-Basics/build/* Click on each table and insert what it ask you to do* Checking to see if it does what it suppose to do.Duration:Short(40 min)Bugs Reported/Investigated:On the Evens and Odds table, if you put a space in between the numbers it only sorts the first number and ignores the second number. It only works if you put a comma between the numbers for it to work correctly. If you put a “0” it puts it in the even array but if I put a space and another number it only puts the zero in a array like I stated above but it puts it in the odds array. Zero is a even number.Data Files: Screenshots or documents that we have found during the session.Test Notes:	Steps to ReproduceGo to the first table Evens and Odds and put in 0 and 1 and click split, an error should pop-up letting you know to put a comma in between numbers, and that zero is not a odd number.Issues: Testing Summary: Tested all the tables and notice that the Evens and Odds is not giving you a error if you put a string of numbers without a comma. And when you put in zero and another number with out the comma it puts zero in the odds array which is wrong.Useability TestThe user experience is not good, the site has tables and doesn’t have any directions how to use it. Its just tables and if you’re not familiar with any of this you will be totally lost. The flow is horrible also. The site would be easy to use if it had directions on how to use each table. The results load very quickly, The tables all work except the Evens and Odds table has some issues.
